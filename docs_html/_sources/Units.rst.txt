Units
=====

For incompressible flow, IAMRÂ supports any self-consistent units, as long as the length, time,
and mass are consistent with the viscosity and diffusivity. For low Mach number flow with
temperature variations, the temperature solve requires a specifc heat capacity,
:math:`c_p`, which is currently hard-coded as :math:`1004.6 J kg^-1 K^-1`
(the specific heat capacity of dry air).
